# SlimVM

## What is SlimVM?

SlimVM is a Linux kernel module specifically designed for [gVisor][gvisor] to
provide hardware virtualization capabilities using Intel VT-x (VMX).

SlimVM is implemented based on [DUNE][dune].

## Why does SlimVM exist?

Accelerate gVisor guest kernel sentry's system calls to the host kernel.

### How it works

In a traditional gVisor + KVM setup, every guest syscall triggers a full VM exit,
returns to the userspace sentry process, which then re-enters the kernel via a
regular syscall — multiple expensive context switches on every operation:

```
gr0 (guest ring 0) -> hr0 (host ring 0, vm_exit)
                   -> hr3 (host ring 3, ioctl return)
                   -> hr0 (re-invoke syscall)
```

SlimVM eliminates this overhead. When the guest executes a `VMCALL`, the VM exits
into VMX root mode where SlimVM directly invokes the host kernel's syscall handler,
then immediately resumes the guest — no userspace round-trip:

```
gr0 (guest ring 0) -> hr0 (vmcall + direct function call)
```

This eliminates expensive context switches between user space and kernel space.

## Features

- **Hardware Virtualization**: Leverages Intel VT-x (VMX) and EPT (Extended Page Tables)
- **System Call Interception**: Intercepts and handles syscalls via `vmcall` instructions
- **Memory Isolation**: Uses EPT for guest physical to host physical address translation
- **Seccomp Integration**: Supports seccomp-BPF filters for syscall filtering
- **Multi-Version Support**: Supports Linux kernels 5.10.y, 5.15.y, and 6.1.y

## Architecture Support

| Architecture   | Status    |
| -------------- | --------- |
| x86_64 (Intel) | Supported |
| AMD            | Planned   |
| ARM            | Planned   |

## Module Conflict

**Notice**: SlimVM conflicts with the `kvm` module because both require exclusive
access to Intel VT-x hardware. You must remove `kvm` before using SlimVM:

```sh
sudo rmmod kvm_intel kvm
```

## Installing from Source

### Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

* Linux kernel headers for your target version (5.10.y, 5.15.y, or 6.1.y)
* GCC and standard build tools
* Root access for module installation

On Debian/Ubuntu:
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

On RHEL/CentOS:
```sh
sudo yum install gcc kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
```

### Building

Build for the current running kernel:
```sh
make
```

Build for a specific kernel version (when headers are installed):
```sh
make BUILD_KERNEL=6.1.0
```

Build using kernel source tree (for cross-compilation or custom kernels):
```sh
# Make sure the kernel source is prepared:
# cd /path/to/linux-6.1.y && make modules_prepare

make KSRC=/path/to/linux-6.1.y BUILD_KERNEL=6.1.y
```

Build with debug logging enabled (activates `pr_debug` output in dmesg):
```sh
make DEBUG=y
```

### Installing

```sh
sudo make install
```

### Loading the Module

```sh
sudo insmod slimvm.ko
# or
sudo modprobe slimvm
```

Check if loaded successfully:
```sh
lsmod | grep slimvm
dmesg | tail -20
```

### Unloading the Module

```sh
sudo rmmod slimvm
```

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

```sh
make clean
```

## Monitoring

SlimVM exposes runtime information via sysctl and procfs:

| Interface                              | Mode       | Description                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/proc/sys/slimvm/slimvm_vcpu_num`     | read-only  | Total vCPU count across all instances |
| `/proc/sys/slimvm/slimvm_vm_num`       | read-only  | Total VM instance count               |
| `/proc/sys/slimvm/slimvm_debug_enable` | read-write | Toggle runtime debug logging          |
| `/proc/slimvm/vm_mem_stat`             | read-only  | Per-instance EPT memory statistics    |

Example:
```sh
# Check number of active instances
cat /proc/sys/slimvm/slimvm_vm_num

# Enable runtime debug logging
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/slimvm/slimvm_debug_enable

# View per-instance EPT statistics (SID, 4K pages, 2M pages, invalidation stats)
cat /proc/slimvm/vm_mem_stat
```

## Uninstalling

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```
